Job Portal Website – Full Project Structure & Database Plan
This document provides a complete structure and step-by-step plan for developing a Job Portal Website using React.js (Frontend), Node.js with Express (Backend), and MongoDB Atlas (Database).
The website will be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across all screen sizes — from small mobile devices to large desktop displays.
When designing the website’s folder structure:
The frontend should contain all front-end files, organized in well-named folders.
The backend should contain all back-end files, also placed in properly named folders for clarity and maintainability.
Additionally, create a separate folder named project_flow.
This folder will store all project documentation that will guide the entire development process.
Before starting any coding or development (through the terminal), you will always refer to this documentation. This ensures you won’t need to ask any questions during development — all necessary details will be clearly mentioned here.
The project_flow folder will include the following subfolders:
tables/
Contains text files describing all database tables (or collections).
Each file should specify the table name, fields, data types, and relationships between tables.
forms/
Contains text files related to all forms used in the admin panel.
Each file should include details like the form name, fields, and their functionality.
queries/
Stores all database queries or API request details as text files.
Each file should describe what the query does and when it’s used.
This structured documentation will help both of us maintain clear progress tracking.
Even if there’s a development gap or the project continues under a different AI subscription, anyone can easily understand the current stage of the project and continue development smoothly by referring to these files.

Once logged in, the user is redirected to the home page to view available jobs.
If login credentials are invalid, an appropriate error message is displayed.

3. Home Page / Job List
The homepage displays a list of approved job postings fetched from the jobs collection.
Users can filter jobs by:
Location
Category (Private, Government, Internship)

Even unregistered users (guests) can browse and view job listings to explore opportunities.
When an unregistered user clicks on “Apply,” a prompt to log in or register appears, encouraging them to create an account before applying.

Recruiters Dashboard & Workflow

All details are stored in the recruiters collection in MongoDB.
The password is stored in hashed form for security.
After successful registration, the recruiter is redirected to the login page.

2. Recruiter Login
Recruiters log in using their registered email and password.
Upon successful login, the recruiter is redirected to their Dashboard.

The Dashboard provides a summary of the company’s job activity, including:
Total Jobs Posted
Pending Jobs (awaiting admin approval)
Approved Jobs (visible to users on the site)
Rejected Jobs (declined by admin)
This section helps recruiters quickly track job status and performance.

4. Post a Job
Recruiters can create a new job posting through the “Post Job” form.
When a job is submitted, it is saved in the jobs collection with the status set to “pending”.
The Admin must review and approve the job before it becomes visible to users on the main site.
Recruiters can view this pending job in the “My Jobs” section until approval.

5. My Jobs
The “My Jobs” section lists all the jobs posted by the recruiter.
Each job displays its current status:
Pending
Approved
Rejected
Recruiters can edit or delete their job listings as needed.
When a job is edited, its status may be reset to “pending” for re-approval (recommended for content control).

6. Company Profile
Recruiters can manage their company information through the “Company Profile” section.
Editable fields include:
Company Name
Contact Number
Address
Password (with confirmation before update)
All updates are saved in the recruiters collection.
Password changes are securely hashed before being stored.
